## Overview

### The challenge

- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css

};
```
